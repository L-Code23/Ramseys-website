              With a passion for problem-solving and a hands-on approach to
              learning, I’ve transitioned into the tech industry after spending
              12 years as a professional brewer. My background as a brewer
              taught me the importance of meticulous organization, proactive
              thinking, and managing projects from start to finish. These skills
              have become the foundation for my work in software development and
              engineering. I graduated from the Grand Circus C#.NET Coding
              Bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in software
              development, debugging, and building APIs. My proficiency in C#,
              along with fluency in version control systems like GitHub, has
              allowed me to contribute effectively to various technical
              projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and value clear
              communication, especially when working across different teams to
              solve complex problems. I’m particularly drawn to roles where I
              can combine my technical skills with project management, working
              to build scalable, user-friendly solutions that make a tangible
              impact. With a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a desire for
              continuous learning, I’m excited about the opportunity to grow and
              contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.
